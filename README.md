# ChromeLens

ChromeLens is a Google Chrome extension that provides a suite of tools to help
with web accessibility development.

### Lens (Vision Simulator)

Interact with a website as a completely/partially blind or a colorblind person. 

### Accessibility Audit

Run a website through an series of accessibility rules and easily discover
elements in your website that do not comply with them.

### Tab-tracker

Key website features should be navigable solely via the keyboard (tab button),
while not making the user jump through hoops to get to a feature. With the
tab-tracker, you can visually track the flow of navigation through a website.
